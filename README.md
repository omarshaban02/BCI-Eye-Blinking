# Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) Prototype for Eye Blink Detection Using EEG Signals

## Abstract

This project presents the design and implementation of a **Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) prototype** for the detection of **eye blinking events** from **electroencephalography (EEG) signals**. The proposed system employs **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** for artifact separation and feature isolation, followed by **Machine Learning (ML) algorithms** for accurate blink classification. The prototype integrates both **signal processing software** and **embedded hardware**, utilizing **Arduino** and **3D-printed components** for real-world implementation.

## Objectives

* To acquire and preprocess EEG signals for reliable analysis
* To isolate ocular artifacts using Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
* To detect eye blinking events through supervised Machine Learning techniques
* To implement a functional BCI prototype using embedded hardware
* To demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based human–machine interaction

## Methodology

1. **EEG Acquisition & Preprocessing**
   Raw EEG signals are filtered to remove noise and baseline drift.

2. **Artifact Separation**
   ICA is applied to decompose EEG signals and isolate eye-blink-related components.

3. **Feature Extraction & Classification**
   Relevant temporal and spectral features are extracted and classified using Machine Learning models.

4. **Hardware Implementation**
   Detection results are transmitted to an **Arduino-based system**, enabling real-time interaction. The physical structure of the prototype is fabricated using **3D printing**.
